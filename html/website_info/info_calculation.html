<h1>Our Calculation Method</h1>

<p>For each valid yard line and distance value in the fourth down, we are calculating the expected points for the drive, punt, and field goal. The formula we believe is articulated by the documents you provided for each of those three choices is:</p>

<p>(points for success of play) * (total success attempts of play / total attempts of play)</p>

<p>And then we take the highest expected point value play and put it into the correct yard line and distance location on our graph.</p>
